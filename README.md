Snake Game

(Project Description):

This project is an implementation of a basic snake game where the objective is to guid the snake to obtain the fruit spawned and grow the snake. The project is built in python using the pygame library. It has five files which separate the functionality of the game using OOP (object oriented programming) with each key attribute of the game such as the fruit, snake, game (rendering and updating screen) all have their own classes. 

(Installation):

Python: 3.10.9
Pygame: pip install pygame==2.3.0

(IMPORTANT): 

1. To run the game, run the game.py file using your local python interpreter in 3.10.9.
2. To tweek the game window size for example, go to board.py and optimize the first parameters to your liking. 
3. Use WASD keys to move the snake while the game is running.
4. Press ESCAPE key to stop the game while its running or click the X in the top right.

(WARNING):

If you are running other python versions of python, make sure your interpreter still supports these versions of python and pygame. Keep in mind the Python API and Pygame module used in the snake game are frequently changing. So, if the code doesn't function properly using your local interpreter, consider installing python 3.10.9.
